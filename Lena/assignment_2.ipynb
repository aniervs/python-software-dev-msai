\\n<p><b><a href=\"/wiki/Ada_Wong\" title=\"Ada Wong\">Ada Wong</a></b> is a fictional character in <i><a href=\"/wiki/Resident_Evil\" title=\"Resident Evil\">Resident Evil</a></i> (<i>Biohazard</i> in Japan), a <a href=\"/wiki/Survival_horror\" title=\"Survival horror\">survival horror</a> video game series created by the Japanese company <a href=\"/wiki/Capcom\" title=\"Capcom\">Capcom</a>. Ada was first mentioned in the original <i><a href=\"/wiki/Resident_Evil_(1996_video_game)\" title=\"Resident Evil (1996 video game)\">Resident Evil</a></i> (1996), before being introduced as a <a href=\"/wiki/Supporting_character\" title=\"Supporting character\">supporting character</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Antihero\" title=\"Antihero\">antiheroine</a> in <i><a href=\"/wiki/Resident_Evil_2\" title=\"Resident Evil 2\">Resident Evil&#160;2</a></i> (1998). The character was initially conceived as a researcher named Linda for the <a href=\"/wiki/Resident_Evil_1.5\" title=\"Resident Evil 1.5\">prototype of the second game</a>, but her name was changed to Ada and she was rewritten as a spy and <a href=\"/wiki/Mercenary\" title=\"Mercenary\">mercenary</a> for the final <a href=\"/wiki/Software_build\" title=\"Software build\">build</a> to connect its story to that of the original. Over the course of the series, Ada is often hired to steal biological weapons for various organizations, although she betrays her employers on numerous occasions to save protagonist Leon S. Kennedy from dire situations. Ada is featured in several <i>Resident Evil</i> games, novelizations, and films, and has also appeared in other game franchises such as <i><a href=\"/wiki/Project_X_Zone\" title=\"Project X Zone\">Project&#160;X Zone</a></i>, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Teppen\" title=\"Teppen\">Teppen</a></i>, and <i><a href=\"/wiki/Dead_by_Daylight\" title=\"Dead by Daylight\">Dead by Daylight</a></i>.
